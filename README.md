# Purpose

GameLang is a high-level imperative programming language developed by Justin Finn, Kimble Culley, and Tiffany Decker. It uses game-like syntax to develop its syntax based on older renditions of programming languages such as COBOL and FORTRAN II, along with some elements from C++. We took our love for games and developed a language with basic functionality.
